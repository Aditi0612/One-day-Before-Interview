K + Minimum = Max Heap
K + Maximum = Min Heap

Parent i then Left child -> 2i+1 and right child is 2i+2

Child i then parent is [i/2]+1

Heap is a complete binary tree and be sorted in an array

Max array size = 2^(j+1)-1 for perfect binary tree


Max nodes at height h = 2^h
Max nodes in entire tree of height h = (2^h+1) - 1

Range of leaves [N/2]+1 to N
Range of internal Nodes 1 to [N/2]
