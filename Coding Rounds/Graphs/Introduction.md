Types of graphsðŸŽŸ 

Undirected graphs 
- U -> V and V -> U
We have edges and nodes

Degree of Graph : total no. of edges connected to the specific node
Degree = 2 x Edges

Path : We cannot visit a node more than once

Cyclic : If we can reach to a node again by following a path then its Undirected cyclic graph

Acyclic : If we cannot reach to a node again by following a path its Undirected acyclic graph

Weights : If we have weights on the edges of the graph then its Weighted undirected  graph

If the problem don't have weight the assume that the graph have unit wait of 1


Directed Graphs

- U -> V

Indegree : Edges coming in to the node
Outdegree : Edges going out to the node

Path : We cannot visit a node more than once

Cyclic : If we can reach to a node again by following a path then its Directed cyclic graph

Acyclic : If we cannot reach to a node again by following a path its Directed acyclic graph (DAG)

Weights : If we have weights on the edges of the graph then its Weighted directed  graph
