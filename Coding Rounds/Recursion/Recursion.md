Make Input smaller ? But Why ?
Recursion - Decision Space
Recursive Tree - Soul of Recursion
2 Steps to solve any recursive Problem

Decision making is the primary goal then input will get smaller automatically
Choice + Decision

Recursive Tree design -> Code 
Use decision table of 0's and 1's which to take and which to loose   
Design the recursion tree



Simple- Function (Base - Condition - Hypothesis ) 
Medium- Decision Tree
Hard- Choice Diagram
