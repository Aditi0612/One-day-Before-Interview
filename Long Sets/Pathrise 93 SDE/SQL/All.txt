- Normalization is the process of creating set schemas to store non-redundant and consistent data.
- DeNormalization is the process of combining all the data sets so that it can be queried speedily.

- To reduce the data redundancy and inconsistency
- To achieve the faster execution of the queries using redundancy.

- Increased no. of tables
- Decreased no. of tables

- Optimized usage of disk space
- Waste of usage of disk space
